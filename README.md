# Hi there 👋
# My name is Kyrylo! 

I am a rising junior at Dartmouth College studying Computer Science 💻 and Neuroscience 🧠.

Many of my repos are *private*, so feel free to [email me](mailto:kyrylo.bakumenko@gmail.com) to view them!

My $${\color{green}Coursework}$$ includes:
- 🤖🎵 Music editing with fine-tuned transformers  
- 🛰️👀 Modelling river-slump growth with computer vision from satellite imagery  
- 📚📊 Understanding cultural differences in literature with LLMs

My $${\color{blue}Research}$$ $${\color{blue}Interests}$$ are:
- Fine-tuning multimodal generative AI  
- Understanding neurodivergent speech patterns with ML by combining vision 👀 with speech 🗣️

In my free time I love piecing apart new puzzles!              Finding new ways to solve a ![image-removebg-preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a498256f-a443-46e1-9a70-a8f6e116c3fb) Rubik's cube (blindfolded)
                                                                🏎️ building racing simulators from scratch
                                                                or modelling 🏈 NFL players.
